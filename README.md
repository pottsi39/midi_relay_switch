# midi_relay_switch
Arduino code to run a 4 module relay with 4 pole LEDs

This is for a small pedal project I was making for my Bass pedalboard. Specifically this project uses a 4 module relay board to switch between two sets of Expression pedals and CTL pedals for my Boss ES-8. The box has 4 stereo inputs and two stereo outputs for teh selection and two 4 pole RGB leds to show which input is selected.
